That’s exciting, Bobbi! For a spa and salon SaaS platform, the appointment setup is one of the most critical onboarding steps—you want it to feel effortless and intuitive from the start. Here’s a checklist of essential settings to guide new users through configuring appointments properly:

### 🗓️ Core Appointment Settings
- **Operating Hours**: Let users define business hours per location or service provider.
- **Breaks & Holidays**: Add options to block out lunch breaks, vacations, and special closures.
- **Time Slot Intervals**: Configure how appointments are spaced—e.g., every 15, 30, or 60 minutes.
- **Booking Lead Time**: Minimum notice required before an appointment can be scheduled.
- **Cancellation Policy**: Define cut-off time for cancellations and optionally enforce fees.

### 👤 Provider & Resource Availability
- **Team Member Schedules**: Set working hours and off-days for each staff member.
- **Service-Specific Availability**: Allow certain providers to offer only specific services at certain times.
- **Room or Equipment Booking**: Ensure rooms, chairs, or devices are available before slot confirmation.

### 🧖 Service Configuration
- **Duration & Padding**: Set service length and add buffer time between appointments.
- **Dependency Rules**: For packages (e.g., massage + facial), link services so they’re booked sequentially.
- **Price Variations**: Allow time-based pricing (e.g., peak vs. off-peak), stylist-tier pricing, or seasonal rates.

### 💬 Notifications & Reminders
- **Auto-Confirm vs. Manual Approval**: Let users choose whether appointments are confirmed automatically.
- **Customer Notifications**: Set up email/SMS reminders for upcoming appointments, cancellations, and reschedules.
- **Staff Alerts**: Enable real-time notifications when appointments are booked or changed.

### 🌐 Booking Experience
- **Online Booking Settings**: Define how far into the future customers can schedule appointments.
- **Custom Booking Pages**: Brand-able URLs for salons with custom fields, FAQs, or intake forms.
- **Customer Restrictions**: Limit rescheduling, enforce login/signup, or apply membership-only rules.

### 📊 Analytics & Safeguards
- **No-show Tracking**: Monitor patterns and take action (e.g., warning popups or ban lists).
- **Waitlists**: Enable customers to join a waitlist if time slots are full.
- **Double-Booking Prevention**: Cross-check time, provider, and service rules to avoid overlaps.
