## Best Practices for User Management

- Regularly audit user accounts and permissions
- Remove access for staff members who leave the organization
- Use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication
- Assign the minimum necessary permissions for each role
- Regularly review user activity logs for suspicious behavior
- Create custom roles instead of giving full admin access to multiple users
