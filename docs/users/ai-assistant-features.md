Based on my audit of the AI Assistant features described in the documentation against the actual code implementation, I've identified several gaps between what's documented and what's currently implemented. Let me provide a detailed analysis of what's present and what needs to be added.

Current Implementation
The codebase currently has:

Basic AI Assistant Framework:
An 
AssistantController
 that handles search functionality using AWS Bedrock for embeddings
A simple chat interface component (
assistant.blade.php
) that allows users to ask questions
Vector database support via pgvector extension for similarity searches
A single route /assistant/search for querying the assistant
Knowledge Base Search:
The system can search through embeddings stored in a database table
Results are ranked by similarity to the query
Content is filtered by source type (help documents)
